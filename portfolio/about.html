                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p><p>I have attended CWI to obtain my <em>Associates of Applied Science</em> for software development. In my time there I learned
                        the client-side technologies. I learned C# back-end programming HTML and CSS. I have worked in the service and labor
                        industries and looked to programming for a very much welcome and challenging change in my path to further my
                        knowledge and skillset.</p>
                            <p>For <strong>almost a year</strong>, I have been exercising problem solving skills and developing a professional persona at <i>The
                        College of Western Idaho</i>. I participated in the CWI esports club and have put in a lot of effort in getting out of
                        my comfort zone and furthering my education.</p></p>
