            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>I have worked at Albertsons when I was 17 as a <b>courtesy clerk</b> and when I turned 18 I was moved to a <b>Produce position</b>
        until I was 21 where I was tasked with managerial duties at times. I then left and worked at a company called
        Phoenix Fire Protection where I ultimately decided I needed better for myself and decided to further my education and learn <i>Software Development</i>
        at CWI.</p>
