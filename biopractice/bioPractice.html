        <h1>About Jesse Hardy</h1>
        <p class="intro">I have attended CWI to obtain my <em>Associates of Applied Science</em> for software development. In my time there I learned
    the client-side technologies. I learned C# back-end programming HTML and CSS. I have worked in the service and labor
    industries and looked to programming for a very much welcome and challenging change in my path to further my
    knowledge and skillset.</p>
        <p>For <strong>almost a year</strong>, I have been exercising problem solving skills and developing a professional persona at <i>The
    College of Western Idaho</i>. I participated in the CWI esports club and have put in a lot of effort in getting out of
    my comfort zone and furthering my education.</p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>I have worked at Albertsons when I was 17 as a <b>courtesy clerk</b> and when I turned 18 I was moved to a <b>Produce position</b>
    until I was 21 where I was tasked with managerial duties at times. I then left and worked at a company called
    Phoenix Fire Protection where I ultimately decided I needed better for myself and decided to further my education and learn <i>Software Development</i>
    at CWI.</p>

    <h2>Hire Me!</h2>
